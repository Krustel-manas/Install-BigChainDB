# BigChainDB Install Script

BigChainDB is essentially a Blockchain Database solution. BigchainDB allows developers and enterprise to deploy blockchain proof-of-concepts, platforms and applications with a blockchain database, supporting a wide range of industries and use cases. It usually is a pain to install on its own. I had this project called Dendrite that heavily used BigChainDB and hence i wrote this script to make it easier to install it everytime on linux.

## How to use?
Just git clone this repo, cd into it and run the install.sh file using the terminal on Linux. This installs all the necessary stuff. You can then run bigchaindb using the run script.
